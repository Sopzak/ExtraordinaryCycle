## Example:

You can propose to focus 20 days on losing weight, and divide it into 4 cycles of 7 days. Where the first 5 days (first phase) you put in 25% effort, then 50%, 75% and in the last 100%.

With this calendar you can put cycles of as many days as necessary in up to 4 different phases.

### Another examples:
-Focus on studying an English module in 100 days. With 25 day cycles.
-Focus 50 days in the gym with a cycle of mass gain and another of fat loss (CUTTING AND BULKING).

Focus on the last few days before the IELTS (English proficiency) test with each phase focusing on one subject.
